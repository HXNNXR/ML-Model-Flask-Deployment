# Neurodevelopmental Disorder Risk Prediction

This project provides a web app for predicting the risk of neurodevelopmental disorders using machine learning. The app takes user input and provides predictions via a simple Flask web interface.

## How It Works

- **Model**: The model was trained using data on neurodevelopmental disorders and is designed to predict the risk of these conditions based on input health data.
- **Web App**: A Flask-based API that serves the model and handles real-time predictions.
- **Deployment**: The app is deployed on [Render](https://render.com) and accessible online.
