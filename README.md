ML Model for Predicting Neurodevelopmental Concerns
Description
This project uses machine learning to predict the risk of neurodevelopmental concerns in children. It is a tool designed to help healthcare professionals assess and track the risk factors associated with neurodevelopmental disorders. The model takes in key health data and provides a risk score that reflects the likelihood of a child having a neurodevelopmental concern.

How It Works
Input: The web application allows users to input health data related to childrenâ€™s growth, development, and medical history. These inputs can include parameters like weight, height, age, medical conditions, and more.

Output: Based on the inputs, the model outputs a risk score indicating the probability of neurodevelopmental concerns. Higher scores represent a higher likelihood of concern.

Technologies Used
Machine Learning: Scikit-learn, pandas
Web Application: Flask, Streamlit
Model Deployment: Render (or any other platform you used)
How to Run It Locally
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/HXNNXR/ML-Model-Flask-Deployment.git
cd ML-Model-Flask-Deployment
Install the necessary dependencies:

bash
Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Flask app:

bash
Copy
streamlit run app.py
The app will be available on http://localhost:8501.

How to Use the App
Open the app in your browser (via the local URL or the deployed link).
Input the relevant data fields (such as age, height, medical conditions, etc.).
Click "Submit" to get the risk score.
